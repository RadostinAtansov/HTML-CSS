                        Tim laid out his vision for what would become the web in a document called “Information Management: A Proposal”. Believe it or not, Tim’s initial proposal was not immediately accepted. In fact, his boss at the time, Mike Sendall, noted the words “Vague but exciting” on the cover.

                        Tim had written the three fundamental technologies that remain the foundation of today’s web (and which you may have seen appear on parts of your web browser):
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            HTML: HyperText Markup Language. The markup (formatting) language for the web.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            URI: Uniform Resource Identifier. A kind of “address” that is unique and used to identify to each resource on the web. It is also commonly called a URL.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Allows for the retrieval of linked resources from across the web.
